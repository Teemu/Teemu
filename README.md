### Hi there 👋

I'm Teemu and I do backend software development with Python. I also dabble a bit on the frontend with my side projects. I'm located in 🇫🇮 Helsinki.

- 🔭 I’m currently maintaining [pytest-sugar](https://github.com/Teemu/pytest-sugar), one of my oldest open-source projects (8 years!)
- 🗺 My code can be found on e.g. [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug](Werkzeug)
- 💬 Check my projects from [my personal site](https://nuudeli.com/). E.g. [Tax Calculator for 🇫🇮 Finland](https://taxes.nuudeli.com/)
- 📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/froball) or [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@teemu).

Nice to meet you!

### Hi there 👋

I'm Teemu, a backend software developer with a passion for Python. I also have experience with frontend development, which I often explore through side projects. I'm based in 🇫🇮 Helsinki, Finland.

- 👨‍💻 Some of my previous open-source projects include [Stellar]([fastmonkeys/stellar](https://github.com/fastmonkeys/stellar)).
- 💬 You can check out more of my projects on [my personal site](https://nuudeli.com/), including the [Tax Calculator for 🇫🇮 Finland](https://taxes.nuudeli.com/)
- 📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/froball) or [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@teemu) if you have any questions or just want to connect.

It's great to meet you!
